# Password Generator Refactor

## Description
This password gen was not functioning as designed, I added functions to get the password gen to create a password that fits criteria selected by the user. Prompts include password length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Once the user chooses what they want for the password, the randomized password will be generated.
